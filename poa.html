                          <p><strong>J Cornelius has lived full-time in Big Canoe since September 2020, and been vacationing in the area for a decade before that.</strong></p>

J has a great eye for the small details but never forgets the high-level strategy and vision. He has a sense of leadership that is unparalleled to any other I have seen in my career history. He's honest and is not afraid to tell you like it is, but he also encourages everyone to participate and voice their opinions.</p>

                                <dd>
                                  <p>Some have said that, because I own two restaurants, I might have a conflict of interest. I brought this exact question to the Board and Election Committee on June 12th. I was the one who raised it first, out of respect for the process and the community.</p>
                                  <p>I met with each current board member one-on-one, and asked each of them if they felt there was a conflict. Each of them said there would only be a conflict in rare and specific situations, and if such a situation came up I could simple abstain from the vote or recuse myself entirely from the conversation. I'm told the board has already sought an opinion on this from their attorney Kim Gaddis, and that the opinion is there is no broad conflict.</p>
                                  <p><strong>This does raise another question:</strong> what about the realtors (or spouses of realtors) who serve or served on the board? Wouldn't their access to key operational and market information give them an advantage? Why is the conflict issue only being raised now?</p>

                                <dt>Competition with the Clubhouse</dt>
                                <dd>
                                  <p>Lucky Hare and Night Train are <em>complimentary to</em>, not <em>in competition with</em> POA amenities. We offer a different menu and a different experience. We serve fresh food (never frozen) prepared daily. Our goal is to fill marketplace gaps and give residents the options they're seeking.</p>
                                  <p>The bigger question is whether the Clubhouse is truly an amenity or a business (and as such, a market participant and competitor)? If it's an amenity, there should be no competition. If it's a business, why is it allowed to lose so much money every year?</p>
                                  <p>Even if the Clubhouse is a commercial business, this is a large community capable of supporting multiple restaurants and entertainment spots. There's no need to compete when we can compliment each other and make the entire community better.</p>

                                <dt>Why Run?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                  <p>A common response when anyone questions or critiques the POA is "Why don't you run for the board?". This is both dismissive and insulting. Imagine if you came to my restuarant and were unhappy whith how a dish was prepared and we said "Why don't you get in the kitchen?".</p>
                                  <p>Like you, I want Big Canoe to prosper... to be the best version of Big Canoe it can be. Board leadership is about listending to the community, providing clear direction based on a common goal, being decisive, and holding management accountable. I believe my skills and experience will help the board do a better job.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Do you have time?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                  <p>Some say being on the board is a 20-40 hour per week commitment. I ask why. Boards should advise and direct the management team, and vote to approve or deny management team requests. That's all.</p>
                                  <p>A board should not be involved in vendor contract negotiations, AECD appeals, etc. These should be handled by Department Heads and the General Manager. We have an entirely different problem if the management team is incapable of handling these things responsibly.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Have you taken Leadership Big Canoe?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>No. While LBC might be a wonderful way to learn more about the history of Big Canoe and <i>"how things work around here"</i>, it is not a prerequisite for holding a board seat. It's more important to understand how things <em>should work</em>.</p>

                                    <p>When I asked the current board what major issues they anticipated facing over the next 3 years, they answered: "we need to get better at communicating and planning." Without knowing the current status of things there is no way for me to know exactly what my board contributions will be. That said, my focus is twofold:</p>
