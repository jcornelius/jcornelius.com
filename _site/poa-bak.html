                            <p>Hello. My name is J Cornelius, and like you, I’m a resident and property owner here in Big Canoe. My wife and I chose this community as our full-time home—not just an investment, but a place we care deeply about.</p>
                            <p>I’m running for the POA Board because I believe in putting the best interests of the community ahead of personal preference. I bring decades of experience in business leadership, governance, and community service, and I’m ready to apply that expertise to help Big Canoe thrive—through thoughtful planning, clear communication, and a commitment to transparency and accountability.</p>

J has a great eye for the small details but never forgets the high-level strategy and vision. He has a sense of leadership that is unparalleled to any other I have seen in my career history. He's honest and is not afraid to tell you like it is, but he also encourages everyone to participate and voice their opinions.</p>

                                  <p>A common response when anyone questions or critiques the POA is "Why don't you run for the board?". This is both dismissive and insulting. Imagine if you were unhappy with how a restaurant dish was prepared and were asked "Why don't you get in the kitchen?".</p>
                                  <p>Like you, I want Big Canoe to prosper... to be the best version of Big Canoe it can be. Board leadership is about listending to the community, providing clear direction based on a common goal, being decisive, and holding management accountable. I believe my skills and experience will help the board do a better job.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Do you have time?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                  <p>Some say serving on the Board takes 20–40 hours a week. It shouldn’t.</p>
                                  <p>Boards are meant to <strong>govern</strong>, not manage day-to-day operations. They provide oversight, make policy decisions, and ensure accountability. Contract negotiations, appeals, and operations should be handled by staff and the General Manager.</p>
                                  <p>If Board members are consumed with operational tasks, <strong>that’s a management problem</strong>, not a Board responsibility. I’d help refocus the Board on what it’s actually meant to do: advise, direct, and hold management accountable.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Have you taken Leadership Big Canoe?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>No. While LBC might be a wonderful way to learn more about the history of Big Canoe and <i>"how things work around here"</i>, it is not a prerequisite for holding a board seat.</p>
                                    <p>Understanding how things have been done is helpful. But understanding how things should be done is essential. Institutional knowledge should support good governance, not override it.</p>

                                    <p>When I asked the current Board what major issues they expect facing in the next three years, their answer was: “We need to get better at planning and communication.”</p> 
                                    <p>That’s telling. Planning is one of the Board’s most fundamental responsibilities. Why have the Strategic Plan and the Long Range plans not been followed?</p>
                                    <p>Clear and consistent communication is critical. We already have a communications team that's being paid almost $400,000 a year. Why has the POA failed at communicating?</p>

                                        <li><strong>Open dialogue with the community</strong>—across multiple channels and in plain language.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Real accountability for leadership</strong>—ensuring management operates with professionalism, integrity, transparency, and fiscal discipline.</li>

                                <dd>
                                  <p>This was the first question I raised out of respect for the process and our community. On June 12th I sent a detailed list of questions to the POA Board and General Manager. From June 25th to 27th, I met individually with each Board member and asked them about this directly. Each one agreed: <em>there would only be a conflict in rare, specific situations, and in those cases, I could simply recuse myself.</em></p>
                                  <p>The Board’s attorney has already provided an opinion that no broad conflict exists. If local business owners are disqualified from serving, what about realtors—or their spouses—who have access to sensitive POA data and continue to serve?</p>
                                  <p>We should be consistent in how we view potential conflicts.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Competition with the Clubhouse</dt>
                                <dd>
                                  <p>Lucky Hare and Night Train Pizza serve a different purpose. We offer fresh, made-from-scratch food and a different dining experience. Our goal is to complement the community—not compete with POA amenities.</p>
                                    <p>The real question is: <i>Is the Clubhouse a community amenity or a commercial business?</i></p>
                                    <p>If it’s truly an amenity, there’s no competition. But if it operates as a business, we should ask: Why is it allowed to lose so much money each year?</p>
                                    <p>Even if the Clubhouse were commercial, Big Canoe and the Marble Hill area is large enough to support multiple restaurants. We should be collaborating to make the community better—<em>not framing neighbors as competitors</em>.</p>
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Why can't we discuss this on Social Media?</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    <p>Great question, and I don't have the answer. However, I want to remain available to listen to the questions, concerns, and advice from the community.</p>
