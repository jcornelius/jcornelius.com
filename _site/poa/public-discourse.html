<p>In every thriving community, open conversation is not a disruption — it’s a sign of health. It means people care. It means they’re paying attention. And in Big Canoe, it means we’re invested in the future of the place we call home.</p>
<p>As a candidate for the POA Board, I respect the work of the Election Committee and the desire to ensure a fair, orderly process. But fairness doesn’t require silence — it requires access. And the current restrictions on where and how candidates can speak to residents during the campaign raise important questions.</p>
<p>Right now, candidates are being told they cannot share campaign-related content on any Big Canoe–related social media platforms, even in groups or pages run by residents. Instead, communication is limited to official POA-controlled channels: a digital profile, a video recording, and two email sends. While those are helpful tools, they are not sufficient.</p>
<p>Residents should be able to engage with candidates where conversations are already happening. They should be able to ask follow-up questions, compare perspectives, and hear how candidates think — not just what’s written in an approved statement. That’s how trust is built. That’s how informed decisions are made.</p>
<p>This is not about disregarding process. It’s about ensuring the process reflects the values of transparency, fairness, and civic participation. Limiting discourse to a narrow set of tightly controlled channels doesn’t level the playing field — it narrows it.</p>

<h3>We can do better.</h3>
<p>Let’s allow candidates to speak freely and responsibly across multiple platforms — including the ones residents already use. Let’s trust our community to have thoughtful conversations. And let’s hold ourselves to a higher standard, not just of civility, but of openness.</p>
<p>This is our election. Our community. Our opportunity to raise the bar.</p>
