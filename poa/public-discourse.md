# In Support of Open Dialogue and Transparent Elections in Big Canoe

In every thriving community, open conversation is not a disruption — it’s a sign of health. It means people care. It means they’re paying attention. And in Big Canoe, it means we’re invested in the future of the place we call home.

As a candidate for the POA Board, I respect the work of the Election Committee and the desire to ensure a fair, orderly process. But fairness doesn’t require silence — it requires access. And the current restrictions on where and how candidates can speak to residents during the campaign raise important questions.

Right now, candidates are being told they cannot share campaign-related content on any Big Canoe–related social media platforms, even in groups or pages run by residents. Instead, communication is limited to official POA-controlled channels: a digital profile, a video recording, and two email sends. While those are helpful tools, they are not sufficient.

Residents should be able to engage with candidates where conversations are already happening. They should be able to ask follow-up questions, compare perspectives, and hear how candidates think — not just what’s written in an approved statement. That’s how trust is built. That’s how informed decisions are made.

This is not about disregarding process. It’s about ensuring the process reflects the values of transparency, fairness, and civic participation. Limiting discourse to a narrow set of tightly controlled channels doesn’t level the playing field — it narrows it.

**We can do better.**

Let’s allow candidates to speak freely and responsibly across multiple platforms — including the ones residents already use. Let’s trust our community to have thoughtful conversations. And let’s hold ourselves to a higher standard, not just of civility, but of openness.

This is our election. Our community. Our opportunity to raise the bar.
