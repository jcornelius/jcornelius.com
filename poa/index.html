                <p><strong>Hello. My name is J Cornelius.</strong></p>
                <p>You may know me from my restaurants, <a href="https://luckyhare.com">Lucky Hare</a> and <a href="https://nighttrainpizza.com">Night Train Pizza</a>, or as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jameswcornelius">James Cornelius</a> on Facebook <em>(Facebook doesn't like single letter first names)</em>.</p>
                <p>Like you, I&rsquo;m both a resident and property owner here in Big Canoe. From the moment my wife and I first visited in 2013, we knew this place was something special. Each return visit only deepened our appreciation for the beauty and spirit of this community. In 2020, we purchased a vacation home—and not long after, we made the decision to make Big Canoe our full-time home. This wasn&rsquo;t just an investment; it was a heartfelt choice, rooted in love for the place and a desire to be part of its future.</p>
                <p>I&rsquo;m running for the POA Board because I believe the future of Big Canoe needs to be protected. I bring decades of experience in business leadership, governance, and community service, and I&rsquo;m ready to apply that expertise to help Big Canoe thrive—through thoughtful planning, clear communication, and a commitment to transparency and accountability.</p>

              <p class="quote__text">For J, nothing is impossible. He&rsquo;s motivated and knows how to get things done, even on ridiculously short notice where others may likely fail. J has a great eye for the small details but never forgets the high-level strategy and vision. He has a sense of leadership that is unparalleled to any other I have seen in my career history. He&rsquo;s honest and is not afraid to tell you like it is, but he also encourages everyone to participate and voice their opinions.</p>

                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Why Run?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Just like you, I care deeply about Big Canoe and the surrounding area. I want to see it thrive—to become the best version of itself for everyone who lives here.</p>
                    <p>As I&rsquo;ve become more involved in the community, I&rsquo;ve noticed some troubling issues—concerns that many friends and neighbors have echoed. Wanting to be constructive, I reached out to the current Board and management to ask thoughtful questions and share these concerns in the spirit of collaboration. Unfortunately, the responses I received were dismissive and lacked the transparency our community deserves.</p>
                    <p>A common response when I've raised these concerns publicly is <em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you run for the board?&rdquo;</em>. That kind of response feels dismissive—like being unhappy with your meal at a restaurant and being told, <em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get in the kitchen?&rdquo;</em>. We should welcome input, not shut it down. Big Canoe deserves open, honest conversations and leadership that respects every voice.</p>
                    <p>Board leadership is about listending to the community, providing clear direction based on a common goal, being decisive, and holding management accountable. I believe my skills and experience will help the board do a better job.</p>
                    <p><em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you run for the board?&rdquo;</em> you ask? Well, here I am.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Do you have time?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Some say serving on the Board takes 20–40 hours a week. It shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
                    <p><strong>Boards are meant to govern</strong>, not manage day-to-day operations. They provide oversight, make policy decisions, and ensure accountability. Contract negotiations, appeals, and operations should be handled by staff and the General Manager.</p>
                    <p>If Board members are consumed with operational tasks, <strong>that&rsquo;s a management problem</strong>, not a Board responsibility. I&rsquo;d help refocus the Board on what it&rsquo;s actually meant to do: advise, direct, and hold management accountable.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Have you taken Leadership Big Canoe?</dt>
                  <dd>
                      <p>No. While LBC might be a wonderful way to learn more about the history of Big Canoe and <i>&ldquo;how things work around here&rdquo;</i>, it is not a prerequisite for holding a board seat.</p>
                      <p>I have completed <strong>several leadership training programs</strong> including Advanced training from the <a href="https://cviog.uga.edu/training/index.html">Carl Vinson Institute of Government at UGA</a>.</p>
                      <p>Understanding how things have been done is helpful. But understanding how things should be done is essential. Institutional knowledge should support good governance, not override it.</p>

                  </dd>
                  <dt>Are you familiar with the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities?</dt>
                  <dd>
                      <p><strong>Yes. The Board&rsquo;s role (as with any board) is to govern, advise, and hold management accountable.</strong></p>
                      <p>At the Board Information Meeting on June 2nd, I asked the current Board what major issues they expect facing in the next three years. Their answer was: <em>&ldquo;We need to get better at planning and communication.&rdquo;</em></p>
                      <p>I've met with each continuing Board member one-on-one to discuss these issues and gather their insights.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Rich McLeod: June 25</li>
                        <li>Sandy Pullara: June 27</li>
                        <li>Craig Price: June 27</li>
                        <li>Jim Conneely: June 27</li>
                        <li>Mike Zeigler: June 30</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We already have a Strategic Plan and a Long Range Plan in place, but management isn&rsquo;t being held accoutable for following them. These are strong tools that can guide our progress. What&rsquo;s needed now is the discipline to follow them and the leadership to ensure they&rsquo;re used effectively.</p>
                      <p>Clear and consistent communication is critical. We already have a communications team that&rsquo;s being paid almost $400,000 a year. The board needs to hold management accountable to deliver clear, consistent messaging that keeps the community informed and engaged.</p>
                      <p>My goal is to bring calm, capable leadership that reinforces what&rsquo;s already working, addresses what&rsquo;s not, and helps the Board operate with greater clarity and purpose.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>What will you do if elected?</dt>
                  <dd>
                      <p><strong>My focus will be on:</strong></p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><strong>Open dialogue with the community</strong>—across multiple channels and in plain language.</li>
                          <li><strong>Real accountability for leadership</strong>—ensuring management operates with professionalism, integrity, transparency, and fiscal discipline.</li>
                      </ol>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>What about Conflict of Interest?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>This was the first question I raised out of respect for the process and our community. On June 12th, I sent a detailed list of questions to the POA Board and General Manager. From June 25th to 27th, I met individually with each Board member and asked them about this directly. Each one agreed: <em>there would only be a conflict in rare, specific situations, and in those cases, I could simply recuse myself.</em></p>
                    <p>The Board&rsquo;s attorney has already provided an opinion that no broad conflict exists. If local business owners are disqualified from serving, what about realtors—or their spouses—who have access to sensitive POA data and continue to serve?</p>
                    <p>We should be consistent in how we view potential conflicts.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Competition with the Clubhouse</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Lucky Hare and Night Train Pizza serve a different purpose. They offer fresh, made-from-scratch food and a different dining experience. The goal with those restaurants is to <em>complement the community</em>&mdash;not compete with POA amenities.</p> <p>Remember: We started these businesses when the Clubhouse was going to be closed for renovation. <a href="https://luckyhare.com/about/" target="_blank">We&rsquo;re not restaurateurs</a>, we&rsquo;re community members trying to fill a gap.</p>
                      <p>The real question is: <i>Is the Clubhouse a community amenity or a commercial business?</i></p>
                      <p>If it&rsquo;s truly an amenity, there&rsquo;s no competition. But if it operates as a business, we should ask: <em>Why is it allowed to be &ldquo;chronically unprofitable&rdquo; and lose so much money each year?</em></p>
                      <p>Even if the Clubhouse were commercial, Big Canoe and the Marble Hill area is large enough to support multiple restaurants. We should be collaborating to make the community better—<em>not framing neighbors as competitors</em>.</p>
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Why can't we discuss this on Social Media?</dt>
                  <dd>
                      <p>Great question. Only the POA Board has the answer. However, <a href="/poa/public-discourse">I do have thoughts on the matter</a>. Regardless of the POA&rsquo;s position on this, I believe all candidates should remain available to listen to the questions, concerns, and advice from the community.</p> 
                  </dd>
                  <dt>Are you concerned about this being a fair election?</dt>
                  <dd>
                      <p>I believe the members of the Election Committee are honest people acting with integrity. My concern isn&rsquo;t about their intentions, but rather about how the process affects the voters&rsquo; ability to make an informed decision.</p>
                      <p>The outcome of the election is ultimately determined by the community, and I&rsquo;m not sure voters have had enough opportunity to fully understand what each candidate stands for. Right now, there are very few ways for candidates to speak directly with residents—or for residents to ask questions and engage in meaningful dialogue. This is largely because the POA controls all campaign communications and restricts candidates from using common channels like social media to connect with the community.</p>
                      <p>A fair election requires not just fair oversight, but also open communication and informed participation. <a href="fair-election">More on that here</a>.</p>
